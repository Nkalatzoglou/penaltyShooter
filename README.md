# penaltyShooter
A penalty shooter game made in unity
This project aims to create an engaging football penalty shooting game using only a mouse for
control.This choice allows players to experience the thrill of penalty shootouts in a simple yet fun
format,appealing to both casual gamers and football lovers.It was my idea for a project since i
saw the project templates(PC mouse only/mobile game).The gameplay revolves around
accurately selecting shot positions,managing power and using upgrades while facing a
challenging goalkeeper.
